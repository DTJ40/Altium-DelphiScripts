MechLayerNames.pas
Altium version compatibility & functionality summary.
Script checks the Altium version & picks a suitable MaxMechLayers count (1 to n).

Only report used/active layers after mech layer 16.
AD17/18 ignores mech layers above 32. 
New AD19 Component Layers are a mech layer Pair with Kind

Can use same .ini file between AD19 & AD17. Layer Kinds will be missing & Component Layers (pair)
 become mech layer pairs.


AD17, AD18
PcbDoc: 32 max mechanical layers.

Script: 1 - 32 mechanical layers supported (name, enabled, colour, mech pairs)

Iterating from 1 to 64 mechlayers does NOT cause any problems in AD17!

 
AD19
PcbDoc: Can be in legacy (AD18) mode or 1024* max mech layers mode.
        Introduces "Layer Kind" type to mech & component (pair) layers

Script: legacy mode same as AD17/AD18
Script: 1024* mode appears to work same as legacy.


API Issues:
There is no support in LayerStack interface for LayerClass = eLayerClass_Mechanical, just empty..
Enumerations & built-in string converions of new Mech Layer Kinds is missing.
